### Hi there 👋


**Ajith11223/Ajith11223** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

🔭 I’m currently working as a Senior Software Engineer, building scalable web applications and cloud-based solutions.

🌱 I’m currently learning more about DevOps practices, serverless architectures, and cloud-native design.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on full-stack projects, SaaS platforms, or anything Node.js / React.js driven.

🤔 I’m looking for help with advanced cloud architecture patterns and microservices scaling strategies.

💬 Ask me about:

Backend with Node.js, NestJS

Frontend with React.js, Next.js

Databases like MongoDB, PostgreSQL

Cloud services (AWS, GCP), CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure as code

📫 How to reach me: ajithm12aji@gmail.com | [LinkedIn] | [Twitter/GitHub Discussions/etc.]

⚡ Fun fact: I started coding with JavaScript and never looked back — I love building elegant, real-time apps with a focus on performance and developer experience.
